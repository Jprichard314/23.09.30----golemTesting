Repository for playing around with Golem functionality.

Sources:

-   [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps: Intro to
    Golem](https://engineering-shiny.org/golem.html)
-   [Golemverse Website](https://golemverse.org/)

Important Takeaways:

-   Call golem to build the repository.
-   I could be wrong, but I think there are some weird interactions that
    I'm getting between RENV an Golem.

ChangeLog:

-   23/09/30 -- Repo Created, RENV Created, Golem Initiated. Set up
    repository for use. for right now, I'm going to switch over to a
    different repo in an R markdown and prototype from there.
